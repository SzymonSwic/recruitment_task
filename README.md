# recruitment_task

This is my solution for stock trading recruitment task in Python.

To keep track of the best buy/sell value I used a heap queue. 
New orders are pushed to the heap based on price or on it's opposite - depending if we're looking for biggest or smallest value)

I assumed that 'order with the best price' is as with bid and ask prices - highest for buy order, lowest for sell order.
